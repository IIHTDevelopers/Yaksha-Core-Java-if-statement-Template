Project Overview
This assessment focuses on evaluating participants' ability to use the if statement in Java for implementing conditional logic. Unlike other assessments, this project strictly avoids the use of if-else constructs. Participants will implement tasks to solve various problems using standalone if statements.

Learning Objectives
After completing this assessment, participants will be able to:

Implement decision-making logic using only the if statement.
Structure conditions to handle multiple scenarios without if-else.
Develop programs that solve real-world problems through standalone conditions.
Work with logical operators to evaluate compound conditions.
Assessment Tasks
Task 1: Check if a Number is Positive or Negative
Write a program to check whether a given integer is positive or negative using standalone if conditions.

Example:

Input: -5
Output:
"The number -5 is negative."
Task 2: Find the Largest of Three Numbers
Write a program to find the largest of three given integers using multiple if conditions.

Example:

Input: a=10, b=20, c=15
Output:
"The largest number is: 20"
Task 3: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
Write a program to check whether a given integer is even or odd using standalone if statements.

Example:

Input: 8
Output:
"The number 8 is even."
Task 4: Check Eligibility to Vote
Write a program to check if a person is eligible to vote using only if statements.

Example:

Input: age=17
Output:
"You are not eligible to vote."
Task 5: Grade Calculation Based on Marks
Write a program to assign grades to a student based on their marks using only if statements:

90 and above: Grade A
75 to 89: Grade B
50 to 74: Grade C
Below 50: Grade F
Example:

Input: marks=85
Output:
"Grade: B"
Steps for Implementation
Task 1: Positive or Negative

Use an if statement to check if the number is greater than 0 (positive).
Use another if statement to check if the number is less than or equal to 0 (negative).
Task 2: Largest of Three Numbers

Use three if statements to compare each number with the others and print the largest.
Task 3: Even or Odd

Use an if statement to check if the number is divisible by 2 (even).
Use another if statement to handle the odd condition.
Task 4: Voting Eligibility

Use an if statement to check if the age is 18 or above.
Use another if statement to handle cases where age is below 18.
Task 5: Grade Calculation

Use separate if statements to check and categorize marks into grades.
